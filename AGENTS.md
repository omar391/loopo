# Shared Rules

- **Worktree isolation:** never edit, stage, or commit directly on `main`; use a dedicated task worktree first.
- Put all code changes in `<repo>/worktrees/<name>/` and switch before editing.
- Keep the repo-owned `/worktrees/*` path gitignored.
- Follow any runtime skill's worktree naming, branch naming, or reconcile flow.
- One worktree = one coherent task.
- Remove temporary worktrees and branches after landing.
- Use per-worktree tool envs (`bin/`, `.venv/`, `.codex-rotate/bin/`).
- Symlink any new or existing `temp`, `tmp`, `_temp`, `_tmp`, `.tmp`, or `.temp` folders to an OS-reclaimable temp location instead of keeping real directories in the repo.
- Run relevant tests/builds/checks before landing.
- **Token discipline:** no user-facing prose unless needed to complete the requested action. Avoid mid-task updates unless blocked or coordination-critical. Act from context; ask only when needed. End with compact `what changed / how / checks` when applicable. Omit logs, diffs, and repeated context unless requested.

# Task Ledger

- If the repo uses a root `tasks.md`, treat it as the canonical execution ledger for the current worktree.
- For a new worktree, replace `tasks.md` with a concise ordered task list derived from the latest user request before editing.
- For a continuation, update the same `tasks.md` in place so it reflects the remaining work accurately.
- Do not land until every item in `tasks.md` is complete and the relevant checks are green.

<!-- BEGIN rules:spec:coding -->

# Coding Baseline

- **Minimal diff**: aim for the smallest code change that satisfies the goal; avoid unnecessary refactors, reformats, or scope creep in the same changeset.
- Keep edits scoped and follow repo idioms.
- Prefer TDD/BDD: write or update tests before (or alongside) the implementation for behavior changes. Apply SOLID only when it reduces churn.
- **Integration tests must use isolated live environments** (sandboxed databases, test accounts, ephemeral services). Never run integration tests against a production runtime or data store.
- Optimize for agentic locality: prefer cohesive production files ~300-500 lines; treat 500+ as a smell and 1,000+ as a split candidate in multi-file modules unless generated, declarative, or inherently cohesive.
- Split by semantic boundary, for example types, I/O, validation, domain logic, UI state/view, CLI parsing/execution, test helpers, or test scenarios.
- Avoid splits where the pieces must always be read or changed together.

<!-- BEGIN rules:spec:ts -->

# TypeScript Rules

- Use explicit boundary types; avoid new `any` without a repo exception.
- Keep external-input/config validators and TS types aligned; update adjacent type/compile checks for public API changes.

# Loopo Agent Guide

## Working Rules

- This repo is `@omar391/loopo`, a deterministic V3 workflow launcher for slug-based quest flows.
- Prefer `bun` for local execution and tests. The main verification commands are the scripts listed in `package.json`.
- Do not edit `.loopo/**` state files directly unless you are intentionally repairing canonical runtime state.
- For `loopo:` requests, use `loopo init "{request}" --cwd <cwd> --runtime <runtime>` and follow compact JSON step output.
- Use `loopo init`, `loopo quest next`, `loopo hook`, `loopo sim`, and `loopo doctor --fix` to exercise lifecycle behavior instead of hand-editing runtime outputs.
- Keep changes aligned with the schema-backed workflow files in `schemas/**`, `assets/**`, and `scripts/**`.
- When changing lifecycle logic, update or run the relevant verification scripts before finishing.
- Treat `tasks.md` as the repo's lifecycle coverage ledger, not as a transient task checklist, unless the user explicitly asks to repurpose it.
- Treat `.loopo/quests/*/tasks.yaml`, quest JSONL files, emitted child commands, and git worktree state as canonical evidence when prose and state disagree.
- Keep parent/root sessions coordinator-only during child execution; child CLI agents own implementation work in dedicated worktrees.
- Keep edits ASCII unless a file already uses non-ASCII characters.
- Avoid destructive git commands and do not revert unrelated user changes.

## Helpful References

- `README.md` for the user-facing CLI surface.
- `tasks.md` for current lifecycle coverage notes.
- `references/core/architecture.md` for controller, lifecycle, runtime hook, ops, and supervisor contracts.
- `references/core/analytical-framework.md` for rigorous reasoning checks.
- `references/core/optimization-framework.md` for deterministic execution discipline.
- `agents/openai.yaml` for the Codex default invocation contract.

## Verification

- Run `bun run scripts/verify_coherency.ts` after documentation, lifecycle, schema, or reference changes.
- Run `bun run scripts/verify_quest_contract.ts` after quest state, schema, or command-surface changes.
- Run `bun run scripts/verify_runtime_hooks.ts` after hook, continuation, drift, or doctor changes.
- Run `bun run verify` before finishing broad lifecycle or architecture changes.
